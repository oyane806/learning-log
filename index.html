		<h1>Oceane's log</h1>
		<p>I am sharing below what I am doing everyday to learn programming.</p>

		<p>I will try as well to write a few small posts to explain concepts I have learned and make it as clear as possible.</p>

		<p>For the moment, I like this single page because it is minimalist. I will think later about using static site generators such as Jekyll.</p>

		<h2>Scopes, locals, closures, globals</h2>
		<p><strong>Scope</strong> determines the visibility of one variable. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible from outside the function.</p>
		<p>Variables declared within a function become <strong>local</strong> to the function. Function can always remember the variables that they could see at creation.</p>
		<p>A variable declared outside a function becomes <strong>global</strong>. All scripts and functions on a webpage can access it. These variables are saved in the window.</p>
		<p>Variables that are not declared in a function but that are not global are <strong>closures</strong>.</p>
